>Once again, there are tools on the interwebz that can help! (There's a clear theme here, from the easiest pico problems, to the hardest ones in other CTFs, search engines are your friend!)  


## Solution
A quick glance a the file shows us a list of rgb color in the hexadecimal format. The best candidate is `#C70002` since it is the only color composed of almost only red.  

And so, the answer is... `C70002`. I lost almost 20 minutes searching for the actual name of that color (either Guardsman Red, Free Speech Red or Venetian Red, depending on the website) but I guess the developper of the tutorials wanted to keep the thing simple.
