# PicoCTF 2017- Level 1 - Binary Exploitation 1

**Title:** Bash Loop  
**Category:** Binary Exploitation  
**Points:** 40  
**Description:**

>We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/bd058e83a119c78a006543d23d9f6422 and try it out!

**Hint:**

>Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

## Solution

First let's navigate to the directory and execute the program once:  
	$ cd /problems/884bb3c8fc9e0dbccc09787c1b016cd4
	$ ls
	bashloop  flag
	$ ./bashloop
	What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096
	$ ./bashloop 1
	Nope. Pick another number between 0 and 4096

So let's use a bash loop to generate all number and exlude the wrong results (containing "Nope"):  
	$ for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop $i | grep -v "Nope."; done
	Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: bcf9ac72d8721c303ae95239c2deacb3


The flag is `bcf9ac72d8721c303ae95239c2deacb3`
