**Title:** What is Web?  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 20  
**Description:**

>Someone told me that some guy came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff". Can you help me figure out what that is? [Website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:52334/).

**Hint:**

>How can you figure out how the webpage is actually built?

## Solution

The website is pretty minimalist, looking at the page's source code we can see the line:  
	The first part of the flag (there are 3 parts) is 72b28b258d2

Checking the css file, we find:  
	The second part of the flag is b2ea021486f

Doing the same with the js file, we find:
	The final part of the flag is ddd5020451d

The solution is `72b28b258d2b2ea021486fddd5020451d`
