# PicoCTF 2017- Level 3 - Web Exploitation 4

**Title:** TW_GR_E3_GtI  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 180  
**Description:**

>Many think the third entry in the Toaster Wars: Going Rogue series didn't live up to Explorers due to its simplified gameplay, but I liked the new plot and ensemble cast better. Anyway, [this one](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:29668/) also has a flag that I can't figure out how to get...  

**Hint:**

>Clearly, you can't get to the flag. But perhaps you don't need to go over to it at all?  

## Solution

The game doesn't work anymore?
