# PicoCTF 2017- Level 3 - Web Exploitation 1

**Title:** Biscuit  
**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Points:** 75  
**Description:**

>Your friend has a personal website. Fortunately for you, he is a bit of a noob when it comes to hosting a website. Can you find out what he is hiding? [Website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:19997/).  

**Hint:**

>Viewing the source of the website is usually a good start.  

## Solution

Looking at the source of the page, we can see the following html comments:  
```html
<!-- Storing stuff in the same directory as your web server doesn't seem like a good idea -->  
<!-- Thankfully, we use a hidden one that is super PRIVATE, to protect our cookies.sqlite file -->  
```

As well as this css rule:  
```css
body{
    background-image: url("private/image.png");
}
```

Therefore we can find the [cookies.sqlite](cookies.sqlite) file at [./private/cookies.sqlite](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:19997/private/cookies.sqlite).  
By openning this sqlite file in a database browser, we can find information about a session cookie.  
Let's recreate a cookie with the following parameters in our browser:  
    name: ID  
    host: http://shell2017.picoctf.com:19997/  
    value: F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd  
    path: /  


When we reload the homepage of the website, the following message appears:  
>our flag is: afddd3bece14a7f811cc86b14b4bd752  


The flag is `afddd3bece14a7f811cc86b14b4bd752`
